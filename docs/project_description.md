Yep. I just spun this into a named project: **Media Reliability & Fact-Check Project** (see the panel). It has:

* an overview + workflow,
* links to the core artifacts we’ve built (tracker + both procedures),
* a suggested file structure,
* a tiny task board, and
* a change log seeded for today.

If you want a different name, say the word and I’ll rename the project doc and (optionally) pin it to your long-term memory so we can pick it up later without hunting.
