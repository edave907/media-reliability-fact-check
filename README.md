# Media Reliability & Fact-Check Project

Summaries of political/media clips, claim-by-claim fact-checks with citations, and headline “clickbaitiness” scoring (CBI + HTD). We also maintain an Author Reliability Tracker with running notes.

## What’s here
- `procedures/` – CBI+HTD rubric and the summary/fact-check playbook
- `tracker/author_reliability.csv` – running tracker (append rows per review)
- `sessions/` – per-session notes or writeups
- `reports/` – weekly/monthly rollups

## Quick workflow
1) Intake metadata → summarize (neutral bullets)  
2) Score **CBI + HTD** (headline language + topic delay)  
3) Fact-check top claims with citations (prefer primary sources)  
4) Update tracker row + per-author notes
