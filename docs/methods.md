Short version: we’re **science-adjacent**, not full lab-coat yet. Solid bones (procedures, citations, reproducibility), but we need stronger controls, blinding, and measurement validation.

# Scorecard (0–5; higher = closer to scientific practice)

* **Clear operationalization** (CBI/HTD rubric, fact-check taxonomy): **4**
* **Falsifiability of claims** (we check verifiable statements, cite sources): **4**
* **Reproducibility** (written procedures, tracker schema, exports): **4**
* **Documentation & provenance** (dates, sources, change logs): **3.5**
* **Pre-analysis planning** (hypotheses before viewing): **2**
* **Sampling strategy** (avoid cherry-picking clips/authors): **2**
* **Blinding / bias controls** (hide author identity while scoring): **1.5**
* **Inter-rater reliability** (two scorers + agreement stats): **1.5**
* **Uncertainty quantification** (confidence levels, strength of evidence): **2.5**
* **Validation of metrics** (does CBI/HTD track real-world “clickiness”?): **2**

Overall: **B- on rigor.** Good structure; needs controls, calibration, and validation.

# What we’re doing well

* **Operational definitions**: CBI/HTD is explicit and weighted; fact-check verdicts are standardized.
* **Traceability**: We’re citing, versioning rubrics, and logging author notes.
* **Reproducibility**: Anyone can follow the playbooks and land close to our results.

# Where we’re light (and how to fix it fast)

1. **Pre-register each review (30 sec template).**

   * Before watching: list 2–3 focal claims you expect to evaluate + your search plan. Locks in intent; reduces confirmation bias.

2. **Two-rater protocol + agreement.**

   * A second scorer independently assigns **CBI/HTD** and **claim verdicts**.
   * Compute **Cohen’s κ** for verdicts and **intraclass correlation** (or simple absolute deltas) for CBI. Flag items with κ < 0.6 for adjudication.

3. **Blinded headline pass.**

   * First CBI/HTD pass with **author/outlet redacted**. Reveal identity only after scoring to write qualitative notes.

4. **Sampling frame.**

   * Define a weekly pull: e.g., top N clips across 3 ideological buckets + N randoms. Publish the selection rule so we’re not cherry-picking.

5. **Confidence + evidence strength.**

   * Add per-claim **Confidence: High/Med/Low** and **Evidence level: Primary / Multi-secondary / Single-source**.
   * Summaries inherit an overall confidence tag.

6. **Metric validation.**

   * Correlate CBI/HTD with external signals (if available): CTR, average view duration, or headline edits. Even a small pilot (n≈30) tells us if the index tracks “clickiness.”

7. **Gold-standard calibration set.**

   * Curate \~20 adjudicated examples (low→high clickbait; clean→messy claims) to train new raters and keep ourselves honest.

8. **Error-correction policy.**

   * If new evidence arrives, update the fact-check with a dated **Revision note** and keep the prior text for auditability.

9. **Version the lexicons/weights.**

   * Every change to CBI terms/weights gets a version tag (e.g., **CBI v1.1 – 2025-09-05**) and a one-line changelog.

10. **Peer spot-checks.**

* Once a month, have an external reviewer re-score 3 random cases. Publish the deltas.

# Minimal templates to drop in now

* **Pre-analysis stub (per clip):**

  * Targets: \[claim A], \[claim B]
  * Expected sources: \[agency/court/company]
  * Search plan: \[site:… + keywords]
  * Confounds to watch: \[partisan framing, selection bias]

* **Rater sheet fields (additions):**

  * `blind_author = yes/no`, `second_rater = name`, `kappa`, `CBI_delta`, `overall_confidence`, `evidence_level`

* **Revision note:**

  * “Revised 2025-09-02: Added court docket; verdict moved from *Mixed* → *Mostly true*.”

If you want, I’ll bake these tweaks into the project docs and add columns to the tracker. Or we can run a 1-week pilot on the two-rater/blinding flow and see how painful (or painless) it is before rolling it out.


Roger that—checkpoint saved.

When you’re ready to kick the **trial run**, we’ve already got the scaffolding:

* **Project hub + tracker**: live and tidy.
* **Procedures**: clickbait (CBI + HTD) and summary/fact-check playbooks are in place.
* **Per-author notes**: rolling logs ready to grow.

When you send the next clip, I’ll:

1. Do the **Summary → CBI/HTD → Fact-check** flow,
2. Add a short **confidence/evidence tag** for each top claim (so we can validate rigor),
3. Update the **Author Reliability Tracker** and per-author notes.

If/when you want the formal **pilot** (to validate the method), say the word and we’ll run this lightweight plan:

* **Sample**: 6–10 clips (mix across outlets/ideologies + 2 randoms).
* **Blinding**: I’ll score headlines before seeing the presenter’s name (you can keep it redacted in the paste).
* **Second pass (optional)**: you (or a teammate) give a quick independent CBI score; we’ll note the delta for agreement.
* **Outputs**: a one-page roll-up with CBI distribution, HTD stats, agreement metrics, and any method tweaks.

Until then, we’re parked. Shoot over the next video whenever; I’ll run the play.
