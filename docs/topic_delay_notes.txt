Absolutely—great signal to add. Let’s bolt on a **Headline → Topic Delay** component and wire it into the Clickbait Index.

# New CBI component: Headline→Topic Delay (HTD)

## What it measures

How long into the video you must watch before the **headline’s topic is first addressed** and then **meaningfully explained**.

* **T₁ (First mention):** first on-screen/verbal reference that clearly matches the headline topic/claim.
* **T₂ (First substantive explanation):** first point with *meat*—evidence, definition, numbers, sources, quotes, or a concrete claim beyond vibes.
* **L:** total video length (seconds).
* **r₁ = T₁/L**, **r₂ = T₂/L** (fractions of total runtime).

## Scoring (adds to CBI; bigger = more clickbaity)

**Delay score = HTD =**

* If **never explained** (no T₂): **+25** (also flag as “headline not supported”).
* Else use **r₂** (explanation delay) with bands:

  * **≤ 10%** of runtime or **≤ 30s** → **−10** (anti-clickbait credit)
  * **10–25%** → **0**
  * **25–50%** → **+8**
  * **> 50%** → **+15**

*(We key on T₂ because “actually tells you something” is what people clicked for. T₁ is useful for diagnostics; see the report block below.)*

## Bonus micro-signals (optional, small weights)

* **Teaser loops** (“after this…” repeated ≥2 before T₂): **+2** (cap +4)
* **Off-topic cold open** (>60s unrelated before T₁): **+3**

## How we’ll show it in your write-ups

In the **Clickbaitiness (CBI)** section I’ll add a mini block:

* **Topic first mentioned:** `mm:ss` (**r₁**%)
* **First substantive explanation:** `mm:ss` (**r₂**%)
* **HTD contribution to CBI:** `±N`
* **Notes:** (e.g., teaser loops, off-topic cold open)

## No timestamps? Two options

* **With timestamps** (preferred): I’ll parse T₁/T₂ directly from the transcript/video.
* **No timestamps:** I’ll estimate using transcript word positions with **\~160 words/min** (or your preferred WPM) to approximate T₁/T₂. It’s a decent proxy.

## Integration into the overall CBI

* Keep the existing “bait” and “antidote” signals.
* Add **HTD** as another term. Max added by HTD = **+15** (or **+25** if never explained); max credit = **−10** for very early explanation.

---

If you want, I can also add these fields to your tracker schema for later aggregation:

* `video_length_sec`, `topic_first_mention_sec (T1)`, `topic_first_explained_sec (T2)`, `delay_ratio (r2)`, `htd_score`.

Say the word and I’ll update the tracker layout; otherwise I’ll just include HTD in every future summary.
